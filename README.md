# VEVAR

This repository contains the code for the VEVAR (Bayesian Varying-Effects Vector Autoregressive) algorithm as described in the manuscript accepted for publication in Human Brain Mapping:

**"Bayesian Varying-Effects Vector Autoregressive Models for Inference of Brain Connectivity Networks and Covariate Effects in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury."**


Authors: Yangfan Ren, Nathan Osborne, Christine B. Peterson, Dana M. DeMaster, Linda Ewing-Cobbs, and Marina Vannucci

## Overview

The VEVAR algorithm is implemented in Python and is designed for analyzing brain connectivity networks and the effects of covariates in pediatric traumatic brain injury.

## Contents

- `VEVAR_functions.py`: Contains all helper functions and the main function for the VEVAR algorithm.
- `Data_gen.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for generating simulation data.
- `data.mat`: Sample simulated data file.
- `Demo.ipynb`: A demonstration notebook for running the VEVAR algorithm using simulated data.
- `Demo.html`: HTML version of the Demo notebook.
- `Network_plot.R`: R script for generating inferred network plots.
- `ROI_names.mat`: Example ROI names used in the plots.

## Usage
