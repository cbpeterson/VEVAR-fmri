## Code authors

Yangfan Ren and Nathan Osborne

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the VEVAR (Bayesian Varying-Effects Vector Autoregressive) algorithm as described in the manuscript accepted for publication in Human Brain Mapping:

**"Bayesian Varying-Effects Vector Autoregressive Models for Inference of Brain Connectivity Networks and Covariate Effects in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury."**


Authors: Yangfan Ren, Nathan Osborne, Christine B. Peterson, Dana M. DeMaster, Linda Ewing-Cobbs, and Marina Vannucci


The VEVAR algorithm is implemented in Python and is designed for analyzing brain connectivity networks and the effects of covariates in pediatric traumatic brain injury.
